        <h1>Thanks for visiting my space, feel free to look around</h1>
        <p>p.s. You're a bit early! Just like me, this site is very much in progress. Right now only my resume is available.
            Since you're here, I'm working on building this entire project without any frameworks so that I gain a deeper understanding of software and web development.
             You won't find any cloned, forked, copy pasta'd, LLM or boilerplate on this site. Every line was written by me.</p>
