        <h1>Thanks for visiting, feel free to look around</h1>
        <p>p.s. You're a bit early! Just like me, this site is very much in progress.
            Since you're here, I'm working on building this entire project without any frameworks so that I gain a deeper understanding of software and web development.
             You won't find any cloned, forked, copy pasta'd, LLM or boilerplate on this site. Every line was written by me.</p>
