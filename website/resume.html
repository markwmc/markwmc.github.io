                <div>
                    <p>Software Developer with 1.5 years of software development 
                experience, transitioning from a 7-year career in Geographic
                Information Systems (GIS) and 4 years Active Duty Army. My 
                background has given me a strong foundation in problem-solving 
                and adaptability. Recently, Iâ€™ve become increasingly focused on
                the aerospace industry, especially projects focused on
                advancing human exploration of other planets and colonization.</p>

                    <h5 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">2024-present</h5>
                    <p>At CyraCom International, I work as a Jr. Software Developer on 
                        the same Product Development team as I was at Tekletics. My 
                        role involves developing and maintaining web applications 
                        integrated with productized internal APIs and utilizing external 
                        APIS. Working on new and existing products across the healthcare 
                        sector including creating Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Cerner
                        apps, as well as maintaining existing codebases and apps. This 
                        has been an incredibly steep learning curve, and I am grateful for 
                        every opportunity to challenge myself and improve. I started the 
                        MS IT program to facilitate my learning and gain a deeper 
                        understanding. </p>

                    <p>
                        at Tekletics, I was humbled by the fact that I was given the 
                        opportunity to learn on the job, in a contract to hire role, working 
                        remotely on a small geographically dispersed agile team. I took 
                        every opportunity to earn my spot, to learn and provide value. 
                        Most of my early contributions were related to my soft skills,
                        willingness to ask questions, and dedicating all my available time 
                        to learning the systems, tools, frameworks, codebases, languages, 
                        and company culture.</p>

                    <h5 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom:0">2020-2023</h5>
                    <p>At Merrick, I worked several government contracts throughout 
                        these 3 years, with some gaps when the contracts were 
                        cancelled by the government. I worked with the U.S. Army Corps 
                        of Engineers (USACE) on the South Pacific Barrier Project (the 
                        border wall) creating maps of sensitive areas, land ownership, 
                        archaeologic discoveries, and construction progress maps. We 
                        were working on the Spatial Data Standards for Facilities, 
                        Infrastructure and Environment (SDSFIE) for data storage when the 
                        contract was cancelled. After that I worked again with USACE to
                        create Urban Tactical Plans for various cities around the world. My 
                        next project was with the U.S. Geological Survey 3D Elevation 
                        Program (3DEP) filtering and classifying LiDAR data. As I neared 
                        the end of 2023, I realized that my work was being replaced by 
                        machine learning, and I had to make a career change before I 
                        became obsolete. After months of research, I decided to do 
                        everything in my power to get into software development. I had 
                        made a lot of mistakes in the career that held me back and kept 
                        me from progressing to where I wanted to be. I was not going to 
                        make those mistakes again</p>

                    <p>At the U.S. Army, I worked at Brigade Headquarters, which 
                        oversaw about 6,000 soldiers divided into several battalions. I 
                        created the maps and intelligence preparation for their training 
                        exercises, as well as brigade-wide training exercises, which I was
                        also present in the field. This included three separate month-long
                        trips to Death Valley during August at the National Training Center 
                        (NTC). I also created products for and participated in the Pacific 
                        Command Joint Training Exercise (Operation Pacific Pathways)
                        which included other friendly nations. I worked primarily with 
                        officers and higher leadership roles to determine their needs and 
                        create actionable maps and charts.</p>
