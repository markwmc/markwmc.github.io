# markwmc.github.io

This is my personal website. I am building it from the ground up and trying to use as few dependencies as possible. I still have a lot of work to do to get it to where I want it.



## Features
- Contact Form: Github Pages does not allow for dynamic websites, so I have used formspree.io instead of connecting to the SQLite database that I have created. You can still view the commented out code onFormSubmit in contact.js that would send form data to the db.


## Technologies
This web app is built with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Express, cors, and sqlite3.
